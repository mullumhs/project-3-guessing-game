# Project 3: Guessing Game

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 3 and the corresponding labs for the MHS Software Engineering class. The focus of this project is to deepen the understanding of loops in Python, including `while` and `for` loops, as well as loop control mechanisms such as `break` and `continue`.

## Main Project: Guessing Game
- File: [`guessing-game.py`](guessing-game.py)
- Description: Create a guessing game that utilises loops and input validation in Python.

## Labs

### Lab 1: While Loops
- File: [`lab1.py`](lab1.py)
- Description: Create and use `while` loops in Python.

### Lab 2: For Loops
- File: [`lab2.py`](lab2.py)
- Description: Create and use `for` loops in Python.

### Lab 3: Loop Validation
- File: [`lab3.py`](lab3.py)
- Description: Learn how to use loops and selection to validate user input.

### Lab 4: Random Numbers
- File: [`lab4.py`](lab4.py)
- Description: Learn how to generate random numbers in Python.
